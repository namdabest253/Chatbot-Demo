65,1,DePaul University,0,null,Personal Statement,https://resources.depaul.edu/career-center/resumes-interviews/Pages/personal-statements.aspx,,,,,"Tips for Writing a Personal StatementGraduate schools often require a written statement—often called a “statement of purpose,” “personal statement” or “letter of intent”—as a part of the application. Some require fairly specific information. Others are unstructured, leaving the applicant free to address a wide range of topics. Usually the purpose is to persuade the admissions committee that you are a distinctive applicant who should be selected.Make sure everything you include supports the overall purpose of the statement, and remember the audience as you draft it. Your readers are professionals in their field, and they are assessing you for fit, distinctions, self‑awareness and quality in order to make their decision.Some do's: And don'ts:Read the instructions carefully. In applications with detailed instructions for the personal statement, not following them can hurt your chances of acceptance.Don’t use the “life story” approach. Stay focused on the program and why you’re an excellent candidate for it.Don’t use a catalog of achievements. Approaching your personal statement as an exhaustive list of what you have done tells little about you as a person.Don’t lecture the reader. The committee knows a lot about the discipline so don’t make unnecessary claims about the field.Spend some time reflecting. Think. Jot down some notes. What are your strengths? What makes you special?Be real. Readers can pick up if you’re not being authentic. Stay focused on who you are and what you bring to the table.## What to write in your personal statementSome programs provide questions or guidance to help you structure your statement. Analyze them. Answer the prompts fully and thoughtfully.Usually graduate and professional schools are interested in the following topics, although the form of the question(s) and answers may vary.Your professional and academic purpose in graduate studyInclude the big issues and questions you are especially interested in tackling, and how you intend to apply your graduate study in terms of your future career or other professional goals. You can demonstrate knowledge about the program by referring to faculty, curriculum or other program details.Your area of specializationWhy are you drawn to this area and how does this program align with your interests and goals? Learn about your area of interest in detail so that you are able to state your preferences using area‑specific language, and be sure it aligns with the program’s faculty and curriculum.How you’re uniquely prepared and qualifiedCorrelate your academic credentials and your extracurricular experience with program criteria to show how they combine to make you a special candidate. Present yourself as a distinct candidate based on your background, interests, goals or passions. Many programs value diversity, so this is also a great place to highlight your background or diverse perspectives.Why this program? Why now?Your statement should convince the committee that this is your top choice of any program. Research the school and describe its special appeal to you. Demonstrate that you know what is involved academically, and that your goals align with the details of the program. Also, make it clear why now is the right time for you to begin this study.Tell them who you are as a personRemember, your readers know nothing about you. Give them a strong sense of who you are as a person. Relate your application to personal experience or passion."

It’s not about treating yourself like a product. Instead, defining your personal brand is about strategically, creatively and professionally presenting what makes you, you.If your resume and cover letter tell your professional story, your personal brand drives the character development. Your brand is the sum total of the things that make you unique and uniquely attractive as a job candidate. In short, it’s all about “Why you?”Experience + Skills + Background + Passions = Your BrandExperienceExperience might be academic (courses, major, projects), an internship, a part- or full‑time job, a volunteer opportunity or any relevant activity that helped you gain knowledge or build skills.""My robust experience in a wide variety of digital media production roles...""""My varied experiences in event planning and design...""SkillsThis part of your brand is all about what you can do!

Brainstorm a couple of ways to craft your brand statement.Fill in the blanks with different combinations of your experiences, skills, background, and passions.""My ______________, _______________, and ________________ make me an excellent candidate.""## Developing Your Elevator PitchOne of the most important elements in networking and building your personal brand is your elevator pitch. A 30‑second pitch or introduction that’s strategically crafted will help you make a meaningful first impression at job fairs, networking events, interviews, and even meetups with student organizations or professors. When developing your elevator pitch, you should showcase your best attributes and make sure it feels authentic and true to you.Your pitch should briefly touch on the following key points:• Your most important characteristics, interests and strengths• What you can offer to the employer and workforce• Your goal in connecting with the individual you’re pitchingIn order to develop an elevator pitch that works for you, it’s important to think about a few basic components that can make up the structure.

Portfolios can be used when applying for internships and jobs, gaining freelancing clients and applying to graduate schools.### Types of portfolios* Academic Portfolios are reflective assessments in academics, research, service and leadership combined with evidence to support your accomplishments. Academic portfolios are common in Education.* Demo Reels, or show reels, are a collection of your best work presented in an audio or video format. In industries like Animation, Film and TV, and Video Games, demo reels allow employers to assess your skill sets and talents and are submitted to employers for industry internships or jobs.* Print Portfolios are physical presentations of your best work that can be in the form of a book, interactive package or binder, for example. Print portfolios contain work such as ad campaigns, designs, illustrations, photographs or writing samples. Although many artists choose to showcase and share their work digitally, print portfolios are still common in industries such as Advertising, Fine Arts, Illustration, Photography and Graphic Design.* Web or Digital Portfolios allow you to showcase your work and skills online for an employer, client or class. Creating a professional digital portfolio provides an opportunity for all majors to show off key skills and talents. A web or digital portfolio (and/or a demo reel) is essential for success in the creative industries.### Ready to create a digital portfolio?Digital portfolios are terrific tools that can help you stand out in the application process.

There are two main pieces of information an employer wants to get during an interview:1. Why you want the job  2. Why they should hire youAll the questions the employer asks during the interview are designed to get more detailed information about these two things. So, to have a successful interview, you must convince the employer of these two things. In addition to your qualifications, the interview is about determining if you will “fit” into the organization.## Types of Interviews• In many job searches, the first interview is a phone screening. This is often conducted by an HR representative and is intended to better understand your qualifications and background. One‑sided video interviews are starting to fulfill this function as well.• The face‑to‑face interview can involve one or multiple staff, asking questions and assessing your candidacy.• A group interview features multiple candidates for the same or related roles. Typically, you are asked to deliver a group activity or work as a team.• Technical interviews are common among engineering, science or IT roles. Essentially, they assess your technical knowledge—as well as your analytical thinking skills.• In a case study interview, common for some business and consulting roles, you will be presented with a challenging business scenario to investigate and propose a solution.## Interviewing with confidenceBeing prepared will give you the confidence you need to successfully highlight your skills and accomplishments during the interviewing process. Because so much of the interview is based on performance, we recommend that you schedule a mock‑interview with Career Center staff or peers. You might even find it helpful to script answers to possible questions as a way to prep.### Drop in or schedule a practice interview• Peer Career Coaches hold drop‑in sessions and can conduct a practice interview with you. Check out the schedule here.• You can schedule an appointment with a Career Community Advisor through Handshake.• Through the Alumni Sharing Knowledge (ASK) network, you can connect with an alumni volunteer or professional in your field that can simulate a job or internship interview and provide one-on‑one guidance. Practice Interviews are offered on a by‑request basis via depaulasknetwork.com.## From the Career Library: Interview Resources• Interview Basics• Prepare for Your Interview• Ask Great Questions in Your Interview• Master the Video Interview• Dress for Success"
