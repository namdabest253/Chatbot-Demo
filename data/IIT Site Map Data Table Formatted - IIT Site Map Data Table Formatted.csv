10,1,Illinois Institute of Technology,0,null,Students,https://www.iit.edu/career-services/students/internships,,,,,"Internships can be part‑time or full‑time—Students must enroll in academic courses each semester in the fall and spring to maintain full‑time status and make progress toward their degrees, even if they are doing full‑time experiences.Internships only award administrative credit—Administrative credits allow students to maintain their full‑time student status at the university but do not give academic credits toward a student’s degree program.Summer semester internships are different than spring and fall semester internships—During the summer term, students are not required to take academic courses because it is considered an optional term by the university.Graduate students cannot take summer courses concurrently with full‑time internships based on policies made by Graduate Academic Affairs. Students who have additional questions about this policy should contact Graduate Academic Affairs.Undergraduate students who are participating in an internship experience are allowed to take summer courses along with their full‑time internship.Internships with administrative credits must span the entire length of an academic term—Students who choose to do internships with administrative credits must start their internship by the first working day after the drop/add date and cannot end any earlier than the last day of courses. Internships where administrative credits are not given offer more flexibility in terms of start and end dates.Final semester internships must be accompanied by on‑campus coursework—Students completing an internship in the final semester are not allowed to exclusively sign up for online coursework. They must have an on‑campus presence to be eligible to do the internship experience.### Benefits1. Apply school knowledge in practical work settings2. Learn which aspects of the profession best suit you3. Networking4. Strengthen résumé5. Monetary compensation6. Possibility to convert to full‑time post‑graduation7. Opportunity for reduced course load while maintaining full‑time status8. Official transcripts will show work terms as part of your history—useful for applications that require transcripts in addition to your résumé and cover letter.### Curricular Practical Training (CPT) And Academic TrainingF‑1 students and J‑1 students seeking to do Experiential Learning must obtain additional approval from the Office of Global Services. F‑1 students will have to obtain CPT work authorization in addition to completing the application forms for the Experiential Learning Office. J‑1 students will have to obtain Academic Training work authorization, which involves the Experiential Learning Office.### Special AnnouncementChicago‑Kent College of Law, Institute of Design, Stuart School of Business, and Department of Psychology students have a different internship application process than students at Mies Campus. Please see specific CPT application links for those departments.### Experiential Learning @ Illinois TechExperiential Learning (“EL”) allows students to apply knowledge directly in non‑academic settings; students can pursue internships, research, and more, empowering learning through doing at Illinois Tech."

At career fairs you can also get insights from alumni who are back to network and recruit talented Scarlet Hawks for their companies. See our Events page or log into Handshake to see upcoming fairs and other recruitment events!## Upcoming Career Fairs:### Save the Date: Thursday, September 25th, 2025Student Registration will open in August 2025## Campus‑Wide Career Fairs at Illinois TechOur campus‑wide career fairs are held every Fall and Spring semester. We offer on‑campus fairs that are usually two days long and are separated by general industry groupings to allow for more companies to attend and make connections with more students and alumni. Virtual career fairs are also available each semester to expand our reach of employers.#### What can you do to prepare for career fairs?• Do your research. Browse the online space to become familiar with how it works. Review the participating employers and what types of jobs they have available. Go to company websites and social media pages to see if they've had any recent news releases. This will help you be more savvy and energized in the conversation and showcase why you're a good fit for the job.• Update your résumé and social media accounts. Make sure your current resume is uploaded to Handshake and Jobs Connected and has been approved by Career Services staff prior to the event. Make sure it's clear, concise, and up-to‑date. Have copies handy for you to refer to during interviews. Be sure to scrub your online profiles of any “unprofessional” posts or photos.• Make some notes. Save some time and prepare your introduction and pre‑write some questions in advance. (Ask about the company culture, upcoming changes, special projects, etc.)• Keep conversations focused and professional. Think of three main selling points about yourself. In most cases, you’ll only have a few minutes to promote yourself, so be ready to get to the point and impress the recruiters!• Dress professionally! Career Services has a Career Clothing Closet for all students. Contact Career Services for information if needed.## Chicago‑Area Career Fairs (Year‑Round)Students who take the initiative in their job search are more successful. In addition to using your existing network, see what networking and job fair events are taking place in your city and put yourself in front of the people who are hiring. Below are external websites that list a variety of job fair events by location.• U.S. Job Fair Directory• Eventbrite Career Fairs• Metro Chicago Jobs• Best Hire Career Fairs## Student Registration and Attendance• Students are encouraged to have a résumé that has been reviewed and approved by Career Services. While not a requirement every fair, a refined résumé makes a huge impression on employers and will give you better opportunities to land an interview!## PreparationSuccess is a direct result of preparation. Make sure you take time to prepare for your employer interactions at career fairs. Here are a few ways to prepare:• Update your résumé• Improve your LinkedIn profile• Research companies of interest• Prepare and rehearse a short introduction• Plan your professional wardrobe – Ask Career Services about the Career Clothing Closet## Virtual Career FairsVirtual career fairs are a great opportunity for students to participate in meaningful conversations with companies and learn about their culture, job requirements, and more. It’s an unintimidating way to pursue opportunities, learn about companies, network, and perfect an elevator pitch, all through short, easy, video‑based discussions.## Professional Image### Style GuidelinesProfessional dress is highly recommended for the campus‑wide career fair. Jeans, T‑shirts, casual shoes (sneakers), shorts, and hats* are discouraged, and we will certainly discuss with any student dressed inappropriately the negative impact that their dress will have on their chances of making a good impression with a company. (*We do not discriminate against headwear worn for religious or cultural identity.) For more details, see the Illinois Tech Career Fair Style Guide below or contact the Office of Campus Life.## Professional PortraitsCareer Services often invites a professional photographer to take professional portraits for students and alumni during the campus‑wide career fairs, free of charge. Career Services will notify career fair registrants of a signup sheet each semester to take advantage of this service. There are a limited amount of slots. Professional portraits can be accessed through the Career Services Department after the fair.## Student Organization Customized Career EventsCareer Services invites student organizations to partner with us! Our active collaboration will benefit your student organization by creating special connections with Career Services, Alumni Affairs, employers, graduate school representatives, and other professionals. We will work with your student leadership and membership to create a set of activities and opportunities to help your organization develop bridges and multiple pathways into the workplace with personalized workshops, opportunities to co‑sponsor events, and co‑host panels.

We also do end‑of‑semester workshops to prepare the newly graduated class for a successful job search.Read more on our workshop descriptions page, and view upcoming workshops on our calendar.### On‑Campus InterviewsOn‑campus interviews (OCIs) bring employers to campus to recruit. Companies may choose an open call session for candidates, or they can choose to pre‑select candidates to interview through Handshake. For this reason, make sure your résumé is frequently updated in the Handshake database, and have it reviewed by an industry professional or a Career Coach.### Career ConnectionsCareer Connections are networking events conducted during each fall and spring semester, often focused on a specific industry or academic department. These allow employers an opportunity to recruit students and alumni in a less structured setting for internships, co‑ops, and full‑time positions. Employers can bring up to three representatives to speak with potential candidates as well as to conduct on‑the‑spot interviews.## Engagement Opportunities for Student OrganizationsCareer Services invites student organizations to partner with us.

15,1,Illinois Institute of Technology,0,null,Resources,https://www.iit.edu/career-services/career-resources,,,,,"Check out the IIT downloadable resume guide. That guide includes resume advice: Your résumé is a marketing tool, not just a job history. It should highlight your value, align with the job description, and be error-free and results-oriented. Layout and Formatting: Keep it to 1 page unless you have 5+ years of relevant experience. Use clear sections: Summary, Education, Skills, Experience, and optionally Honors/Volunteer. Set margins between 0.5–1”, font size 10–12 pt, and ensure consistent formatting. Avoid design elements that confuse ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).  Contact Info: Include your full name, city/state, phone, email, and optional LinkedIn/GitHub. Do not place contact info in headers. Summary Section (Optional): Use if you're changing careers or need to clarify goals. Briefly summarize your degree, specialization, and career goal. Example: “Master of Chemical Engineering with lab and project experience. Specializing in petro-chemical process engineering. Seeking process engineer role at Acme Products Ltd.”  Education: List schools in reverse chronological order. Include full school name, location, degree earned, graduation date, and GPA if above 3.0. Optional: include relevant coursework.  Skills: Highlight technical, computer, and language skills. Leave out soft skills like communication or leadership. Only list what you're comfortable using on the job.  Experience: Include jobs, internships, projects, and volunteer work. Use action verbs and quantify results. Apply the PARS method (Problem, Action, Result, Skills). Tailor bullet points to the job description. Format projects like jobs with titles, dates, and impact statements.  Honors and Activities: Include service, leadership, and co-curricular roles that show your strengths and values.  Action Verbs: Use powerful verbs like developed, led, analyzed, implemented, coached, resolved, designed. Avoid weak language like “responsible for.”\n\nOverall Tip: Make your résumé readable by both humans and software. Focus on clarity, relevance, and results."
