Career Services offers recruiting opportunities throughout the year, including career fairs, on-campus recruiting and information sessions. For the latest information, log-in to Handshake.

Preparing for Career Fairs
When you attend a career fair, you can expect many of the same experiences whether it's in-person or virtual, such as meeting the employer, getting an opportunity to ask questions about a company, etc. So how is a virtual career fair different from an in-person fair?

Below, you'll find everything you need to know to prepare yourself for both types of events. 

FAQs
How Should My Handshake Profile Appear To Recruiters? What Updates Do I Need To Make?
Make sure your graduations date, school year, major, GPA, and work authorization are accurate. You aren't required to include your GPA, but that may limit which employers you can have 1:1 sessions with. Add the job types, locations, and roles that interest you, as well as your courses, skills, and any previous work experience. You can also add a professional profile photo if you have one.

How Do I Prepare For An In-Person Career Fair?
Review the list of companies registered in Handshake for the fair and research those that interest you. Update your resume and have it reviewed. Practice introducing yourself. On the day of the fair, go early if you can and meet first with employers who don't have long lines of students to make the most use of your time. Ask recruiters for their business cards and follow-up via email after the fair.

How Do I Find Out If An Employer Values Diversity, Equity and Inclusion?
There are several ways to research employers prior to a fair, event or interview, using a DEI lens:

Go to the company’s “About Us” or “Leadership” page. What does the leadership team or board of directors look like? How diverse is the team?
How does the company represent itself through words and images on its website and social channels? Who is represented, and how?
Does the company have a DEI mission statement? What does it say? Where does it appear on the organization’s website?
Does the organization share numbers or data to support claims of equity?
When you look at the company’s website, social channels, and news mentions, what evidence can you find about actions they are taking to support DEI?
Is the organization featured on lists of inclusive companies, like the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index?
What do employees say online about their experience working at the company? You might find such information on blogs or websites like Glassdoor.
Looking at the company careers page, what diversity recruitment programs do they offer? How do they define diversity within these programs? What do these programs entail?
 

What Should I Wear To A Career Fair?
For all fairs or Career Services events, whether in-person or virtual, business professional attire is suggested.  
Students are encouraged to dress in a manner consistent with their identities (race, religion, gender identity/expression, etc.), background, and professional aspirations. 
Business professional attire might include a business suit, dress pants, or professional skirt with a collared dress shirt or blouse and matching jacket, or tailored dress, along with polished dress shoes (heels should be under 3"") and conservative makeup/nail polish. Clothes should be clean and wrinkle-free.
What's My Elevator Pitch?
Your elevator pitch is a quick and conversational introduction. It usually includes your name, school year, area of study, and relevant experience or credentials. It can also include why you are interested in the company. For example, ""It's nice to meet you. My name is Louis Wolfe. I'm a junior studying English here at Loyola. I manage the newsletter and social media for my club soccer team and am hoping to find an internship or job where I can learn more about communications. I think your company does great work for senior citizens in Chicago and would be interested in helping you spread the word."" For more information and examples, check out Handshake.

 

What Questions Should I Ask Employers?
Prepare and ask questions you are genuinely interested in learning. These can be questions about the company as a whole, like ""How would you describe the company's culture?"". Or, these can be questions about the specific role you are talking about, like ""What does a typical day as an account manager look like?"". It's a good idea to research the company and/or open roles so that you can prepare informed questions ahead of time. Check out Handshake for more tips and examples.

Virtual Career Fairs/Events: Technical Preparation
To participate in LUC's Virtual Career Fairs, students must register and schedule meeting times with employers. First, be sure to claim your Handshake account and complete your profile.
To register, go to Handshake's Events page and click on the virtual career fair you want to attend. On the fair's page, click the purple ""Register"" button in the top right corner.
After registering, set-up your schedule to meet with employers. Each employer will create available meeting slots which will be either 30-minute, Group Sessions or 10-minute, 1:1 Sessions. You will need to schedule sessions prior to their start time to be able to join them.
Test your technology prior to the fair. You'll need to use a supported browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari (do not use Explorer). You'll also want a good internet connection, speakers/microphone, and a webcam.
Before the Virtual Career Fair: Personal Preparation
Polish up your resume in Handshake with these guides, or get help from Career Services by making an appointment or attending virtual drop-ins.
Research the employer(s) you plan to meet and prepare a quick elevator pitch for yourself. You'll want to be able to give an overview of your background, studies, and career goals. It's also a good idea to have some questions prepared to ask the employer(s).
Plan to present yourself professionally. This means wearing a nice outfit and finding a quiet spot with a neutral background for your video.
Add calendar reminders for yourself for each session. You must log-in to Handshake to attend.
During the Virtual Career Fair
Log in to Handshake and go to the page for the virtual fair. You'll see your schedule there and will be able to click ""Join"" when it is time for your session(s).
Be sure to arrive on time to your sessions. You won't be able to join them late.
When talking with employers, be sure to maintain eye contact, practice active listening, and ask questions. Treat this interaction like a job interview.
Ask for contact information and next steps from the employer.
How Do I Follow-up After A Career Fair/Event?
Following-up with employers is key. You can send a brief email or personalized LinkedIn invite to thank the employer(s) for their time and express your interest in them.
See if an employer has job or internship opportunities that you are interested in and consider applying for them.
Give yourself a pat on the back for successfully participating in a career fair!

If you are a Ph.D. student and your goal is to secure an academic faculty position, it’s important to follow the process laid out by your current academic department and to consult with your department chair. Strategies for securing a position vary by discipline. For instance, if you are a student within the department of English, you can learn about the School’s recent placements and the recommended process. 

For most disciplines, published work is critical to getting hired. It’s also wise to network at conferences and serve on association committees while you are a student.  

Know that no matter your discipline of study, expect to: 

Apply a year prior to the position start date.
Balance your job application materials with completing your dissertation.
Prepare a curriculum vitae and cover letters.
Draft a statement of teaching and research (Source: Purdue Online Writing Lab)  
Organize additional materials, such as: course evaluations from your students, sample syllabi, transcripts, letters of recommendation (from your PI, dissertation advisor, professors) and writing samples.
You may be asked to prepare a presentation.
Polish your interviewing skills; check out Career Services’ BIG Interview platform which includes hundreds of specialized trainings. 
Interviewing Stages  
Be prepared for several stages of interviews if your application is being considered. Most likely, the first interview will be via video conference or phone. If you make the final stages, you will be invited to campus for a full day or two of interviews. You should also be prepared for a dinner meeting. 

Have a Plan 'B'
Landing a full-time position can be difficult and doesn’t always happen.

Give yourself a solid chance by staying in close communication with your department chair and remaining on top of hiring trends in your discipline. Monitor news publications, including Highered360, the Chronicle of Higher Education, and other trade publications for available positions. Analyze salary data and make sure you know how to negotiate your salary. Career Services can help you every step of the way. Make an appointment on Handshake.  "

There are several ways to fund your graduate or professional education at Loyola University Chicago. Internal options include scholarships, grants, work-study, assistantships and fellowships. In addition, there are numerous external options available for students to obtain funding for their respective programs.  

Scholarships  
Loyola offers several scholarship opportunities to graduate and professional students, including: 

Graduate School Tuition Scholarship  
Quinlan School of Business Graduate Scholarships  
School of Law Merit Scholarships   
Grants  
While most of the grants that Loyola offers are available to only the undergraduate population, the TEACH grant is available to both graduate and undergraduate students who intend to teach full-time in high-need subject areas for at least four years at schools that serve students from low-income families.  

Federal Work-Study  
Graduate students eligible for federal work-study can work part-time on campus or at a community-based service organization. This program gives students the opportunity to gain relevant work experience in addition to financial support. 

Assistantships and Fellowships  
Assistantships are paid academic appointments made to a graduate student that involve work relating to your program, such as part-time teaching or academic research.  Assistant awards typically include a stipend, tuition scholarship and health insurance coverage. These awards are renewable.  NOTE:  LUC departments may use the generic term “Graduate Assistant” to describe work-study roles that are not necessarily fully funded “Assistantships”. 

Fellowships are paid academic awards that also provide stipends, tuition scholarships, and health insurance; however, most fellowships do not require service on the part of the student. Recipients of Loyola’s fellowships must adhere to the merit award policies in addition to the requirements of the fellowship.    

Loans  
As a Loyola student you have options when it comes to borrowing funds for your education including:  

Federal Student Loans: Loyola participates in a low-interest loan program to help students finance the cost of education. Students can work with the Financial Aid Office to obtain Federal Graduate Loans and Nursing Student Loans.  
Private Loans: Private loans allow students to borrow from banks or other financial institutions.   
External Resources  
Students are encouraged to seek outside funding to help cover graduate education costs. For more information, check out Loyola’s external funding resources page. While it is not an exhaustive list of funding options, it is a great place to start!

What motivates you? What are your needs? What environments do you thrive in? What tasks do you tend to enjoy? What kind of people do you enjoy working with/being around? Leverage that understanding of yourself to identify careers with employers that are best suited to you (and you to them). When this is done right, our job satisfaction and success should trend up and to the right as we grow our understanding of ourselves and the kinds of roles that suit us best.

Career paths are not linear, if they are, stop… and see what’s going on.  
You must pause at times to just have coffee or tea.  
Things aren’t always easy, but they might be worth it.  
And great advice from great philosopher stated: “It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn’t use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like, ‘What about lunch?’”

Thinking of changing your major? Undecided? Do you love your classes but feel unsure of how your major will translate into a career? This 1-credit class will help you assess your skills, aptitudes, interests, and motivational and personality preferences, then critically research applicable career paths. It is ideal for 1st/2nd year students. You'll leave with new ideas, valuable tools, and a personal action plan.

According to 2021 course evaluations, here are some student comments about UNIV 102:

""This class has really helped me learn about my interest, values, skills, and has shown me how I can apply them to find a field of work that would fit for me.""
""It was really engaging with all the assessments we took and the different aspects of careers we talked about.""
""Overall, I feel much more prepared to enter adulthood knowing that I have a plan and that wouldn’t have been easily achieved without this class."" 
""Not only did the assessments help my decision making, but it also helped my motivation.""
""I truly loved coming to this class, and I learned a lot of valuable information that will help me in the future!""

""I initially enrolled in the UNIV 224 course my second semester senior year as a blowoff/ 'easy A' class. This class ended up helping me in ways I didn't realize I needed help in! Tips and feedback on professional sites, cover letters and resumes, and even interviews made getting a job less than 2 months out of college a piece of cake. I highly recommend this course, as I don't think I would've landed the full time position I did without the skills this class gave me."" - Dee Napathalung, LUC Alum

Career and Life Planning Seminar is a 3.0-credit, semester long introduction to career-development perspectives, tools, and strategies. This course will help you clarify career identity and appropriate pathways, develop effective application materials, networking and job/internship search skills, as well as plan for next steps after LUC. It is recommended for 3rd/4th year students.

As a participant in this class, you will:

Trying new things and meeting new people can expand your horizons and give you new perspectives on your personal strengths, interests, and skills. Most organizations value applicants who have significant experience outside of the classroom, and the perspective that comes from living outside the supports of college life. 

If you are having difficulty securing full-time work, volunteer or internship experiences can help you continue to build skills, as well as your professional network. Developing or improving on these valuable transferable skills is a 'positive' to most employers. A recent graduate who makes the most of their gap year experience appears motivated and resourceful, so give it a try!"

Considering Grad School
Why Am I Considering Graduate School?
If you are avoiding making life-career decisions or considering grad school because you don't know any other options, or you are feeling external pressure, these are not good reasons to apply. If you are clear enough in your own career interests to go directly to grad school, you know the field and day-to-day life of the career, then you are in a good position to apply. 

Is graduate school the right choice for me right now?
Timing matters. Ask yourself:

Do I need a break from the lifestyle of a student?

Do I know exactly what I want to study?

Am I ready to enter a program of study that will take me two or more years to complete?

Have I researched my chosen career to determine the optimum timing for graduate school (i.e. Does an advanced degree in my field require a pre-requisite number of years of work experience?)

Is graduate school the right choice given my career goals?
Important questions to ask yourself, include: Does my chosen field require an advanced degree? Do I know that it makes me more marketablein the future? Are there alternative routes to my career goals? Will a higher degree really affect my salary in my chosen field? Could I qualify for a position in my field without an advanced degree? A useful way to address these questions is through informational interviewing. 

 

How will I navigate the logistics of graduate school?
Consider the commitments: 

Extensive, rigorous, independent academic work
Finances needed to pay for tuition, room and board, etc
Ability to live on a limited budget
Full-time or part-time programs should be analyzed based on your financial and lifestyle preferences. For instance, many part-time programs allow you to work a full-time job and attend classes in the evenings or weekends
The decision to attend graduate school is a commitment to the idea after extensive self-exploration and research. The following is a list of several questions you may want to ask yourself. "

Basics of Credential Files
What is a credential file?
A credential file, also called a dossier or placement file, is a professional file that stores information for your application for employment or graduate school admission. It contains non-specifically address letters of recommendation along with other documents such as your curriculum vitae or resume, writing samples, dissertation abstract, student teaching evaluations, transcripts, philosophy of teaching, proposed research, certifications, and other evidence of skills, abilities or qualifications.

Why create a credential file?
Credential files provide a professional, convenient, dependable system to aid in the job application process. It is a way to organize and send your information to potential employers. It also eliminates the time-consuming process of continuously compiling the necessary documents for various applications. Finally, it allows your information to reach the employer in one complete package.

Who should create a credential file?
a PhD or PhD candidate to send academic credentials to a search committee
a premed student applying to medical schools
an undergraduate to send application materials to certain graduate and professional schools
a teacher to apply to a teaching position in higher education

Finish in Chicago.
Rome Start is a unique program for students attending high school outside of the United States and for select American high school students with an international interest. If admitted, you’ll spend the first year of your Loyola experience studying at our Rome Center campus in Italy and then complete your degree in Chicago.

The program is open to international students and U.S. citizens with strong international interests.
Admission to the Rome Start program includes admission to Loyola University Chicago. The application for admission also serves as an application for Loyola’s merit scholarships, which can be used both in Rome and in Chicago.


Life on campus
Life in Rome
As a Rome Start student, you’ll become an integrated member of the close-knit community at Loyola’s Rome Center. The Rome Center hosts approximately 240 Rome Start and Study Abroad students each semester. From daily life on campus to the intramural soccer league to on-site classes around Rome, you’ll find ample opportunities to get to know your peers and make lifelong friends.

Academics
Starting out in Rome, you’ll immerse yourself in challenging and interesting coursework based in Loyola’s Core Curriculum, which is required regardless of your majors. You’ll be automatically enrolled in three Core courses each semester, which are taken together with your cohort. All classes are taught in English, except, of course, for Italian language courses.

In addition to the Core classes, you’ll also be able to select two elective courses each semester. These may be courses within your major, additional Core courses, or simply classes you find interesting. Generally, you’ll be able to complete much of the required Core courses in Rome, and focus on courses in your major once you transition to Chicago.

In Rome, you’ll benefit from small class sizes and an international learning environment. You’ll not only learn from your historical and cultural surroundings, but also from the various experiences of your fellow classmates, who will have come from all over the world.

Housing
Residence life is an important part of the Loyola experience. Living with your peers leads to lifelong friendships with roommates, neighbors, faculty, and staff members. As a Rome Start student, you’ll live on campus with your cohort at the Rome Center residence hall. Check your student portal for more information on housing and other next steps!

Life After Rome
Upon moving to Chicago, you will join a community of over 12,000 undergraduate students and over 5,000 graduate and professional students. You will have the chance to further explore 80 undergraduate major and minor options. You will still enjoy small class sizes and close relationships with your professors. In fact, our student-faculty ratio in Chicago is just 13:1.

When you begin your second year at Loyola, you will have the opportunity to participate in one of the more than 200 of Loyola’s clubs and organizations. You can also participate, either as a fan or an athlete, in Loyola’s athletic programs.

You’ll also be able to explore Chicago and take advantage of Loyola’s out-of-the-classroom learning opportunities, including internships throughout Chicago, service-learning, and research projects."
